> **Effortlessly enhance your prompts and elevate your ComfyUI image generation!**

## Key Features:

* **Fooocus V2 Expansion Algorithm:** Implements the powerful prompt expansion logic from Fooocus, known for its ability to create highly detailed and stylistically rich prompts.
* **Seamless ComfyUI Integration:**  Works as a native custom node within ComfyUI, easily incorporated into your existing workflows.
* **Improved Prompt Detail:** Expands simple prompts into elaborate and nuanced descriptions, leading to more detailed and visually appealing images.
* **Inspired by Fooocus:**  Faithfully adapted from the original [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus/) project and the [LykosAI - GPT-Prompt-Expansion-Fooocus-v2](https://huggingface.co/LykosAI/GPT-Prompt-Expansion-Fooocus-v2) resource.
* **Ready-to-Use Workflow:**  Includes a complete ComfyUI workflow example (see below) to get you started immediately.

## Get Started:

**1. Installation:**

* **Using ComfyUI Manager (Recommended):**
    * Open ComfyUI Manager.
    * Go to "Install Custom Nodes".
    * Search for `fooocus-v2-expansion` or `ComfyUI-Fooocus-V2-Expansion` and install it.
    * **Restart ComfyUI after installation.**

* **Install via Git URL:**
    * Navigate to your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory.
    * Clone this repository using git:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/PanicTitan/ComfyUI-Fooocus-V2-Expansion.git
      ```
    * **Restart ComfyUI after installation.**

**Warning:**

* **GPT-2 Model Download:** The first time you use the "Fooocus V2 Expansion" node, it will download the GPT-2 model (approximately 351MB) required for prompt expansion. This download is necessary and will only happen once. Please be patient while the model is downloaded.

**2. Install Workflow Dependencies:**

* **ComfyUI Manager (Recommended):** If you installed via ComfyUI Manager, it will likely prompt you to install missing dependencies after installation. Click "Install Missing" to automatically install any required Python packages.
* **Manual Installation:** If you installed manually via Git URL, you may need to manually install workflow dependencies [ComfyUI-Easy-Use](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use), [ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes](https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes) and (optional) [ComfyUI-Crystools](https://github.com/crystian/ComfyUI-Crystools).

**3. Download Essential Models:**

This workflow is designed to work optimally with models and LoRAs commonly used in Fooocus. You can download them here:

* **Main Model (Juggernaut XL v8 - Fooocus Recommended):**
    * [juggernautXL_v8Rundiffusion.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/RunDiffusion/Juggernaut-XL-v8/resolve/main/juggernautXL_v8Rundiffusion.safetensors)
    * Place this model in your `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints` directory.

* **SDXL Offset LoRA (For enhanced style):**
    * [sd_xl_offset_example-lora_1.0.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/resolve/main/sd_xl_offset_example-lora_1.0.safetensors)
    * Place this LoRA in your `ComfyUI/models/loras` directory.

**4. Load the Workflow:**

* Download the example workflow JSON file: [Fooocus-ComfyUI.json](https://github.com/PanicTitan/ComfyUI-Fooocus-V2-Expansion/blob/main/Fooocus-ComfyUI.json)
* In ComfyUI, drag and drop the `Fooocus-ComfyUI.json` file onto the interface.
* Ensure you have the required models and LoRA loaded correctly (CheckpointLoaderSimple and LoraLoader nodes in the workflow).

**5. Run and Enjoy!**

* Modify the "Positive Prompt" and "Negative Prompt" text boxes to your liking.
* Click "Queue" to generate your image with Fooocus-expanded prompts.
* Observe the "Expanded Prompt" and "Styled Prompts" nodes to see the prompt expansion in action!
